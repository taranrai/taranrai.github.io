            <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 10px;">I do AI/ML engineering and data science things. </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 10px;"> My research interests typically involve applied AI/ML in the animal and human health domains. However, I also apply AI/ML to other areas like finance and do general data science things. I've also developed a growing interest in the human-technology interaction aspect of AI/ML, with a deeper focus on human-centric approaches.  </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 10px;"> I also Guest Lecture for <a href="https://catalogue.surrey.ac.uk/2023-4/module/EEEM005">AI and AI Programming</a> at the University of Surrey, School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, introducing neural networks. </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 10px;"> I completed my PhD in AI/ML for digital pathology where my research focused on deep learning and computer vision for grading tasks in canine sarcoma biopsy images. I also hold an MSc in Data Science from City, University of London and a BA (Dual Hons) in Economics and Finance from Keele University. </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 10px;">
           There are plenty of things I care about and most of my interests have been shaped by my life experiences. I only really involve myself in projects that interest me. Here are some of those interests, however, this is by no means an exhaustive list:
            <br><br>
            <span style="display: block; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
              <strong>üî¨ Computational pathology:</strong> Most of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-sK0WvQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao"> my research</a> has focused on computational pathology, applying and developing AI/ML models for the animal and human health domains.
              <br><br>
              <strong>üìà Finance:</strong> My career started over a decade ago in the finance domain. Over the years I've taken an interest in financial education especially in regard to investing. There‚Äôs a significant knowledge gap between investment professionals and the general public. I'm collaborating with a few investment professionals to help bridge this knowledge gap.
              <br><br>
              <strong>üåæ Farming and nature:</strong> Protecting and providing for future generations is something I feel passionate about. This is especially true in the context of farming and planting lots of trees.
              <br><br>
              <strong>üéóÔ∏è Liver health and liver cancer awareness:</strong> My father passed away from liver cancer in 2024 and this has had a deep impact on me and my family. I will dedicate a part of my life to raise awareness on liver health, whether it is through research or doing charity work. We've created LiverSWAT at outreach charity NishkamSWAT and are currently fundraising to purchase a FibroScan for liver screening roadshow events around the UK. More details can be found in this <a href="https://www.nishkamswat.com/articles/a-personal-mission-the-importance-of-liver-health/"> blog post.</a>.
